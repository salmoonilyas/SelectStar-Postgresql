# SelectStar  

SelectStar is an **interactive book for learning SQL**. It is free of charge, and it helps you learn by running queries against a real-world dataset to complete projects of consequence.

## About this Project

I have used the database along with the storyline from the SelectStar and implemented the queries in Postgresql using python notebook along with the plots.

## Dataset

The dataset documents Texas death row inmates executed from 1976, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, to the present. It was extracted from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website using automatic means where possible. However, much of the pre-1995 data is only available as images of physical documents and these required manual extraction.

The raw data is available as a csv for [download](https://selectstarsql.com/data/tx_deathrow_full.csv). Because of the manual extraction and cleaning that was done, it is probably the most complete set of Texas death row data on the internet.
